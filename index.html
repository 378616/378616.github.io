        <p class="pink-text">Hi, I'm Jian, pronounced with the 'a'. Long story. I have no capital letters in my subheadings, not because I'm lazy or I don't know how to use them, but because <i>aesthetic</i>. I'm thirteen-years-old and either an ESTJ or an ESFJ, quizzes can never decide. I'm either a Gryffindor, Hufflepuff or a Slytherin, quizzes can never decide that either. 'Why don't you just identify with one then??' It's not that simple. The one thing quizzes <i>can</i> agree on, though, is that I am a True Neutral. That's about the only thing though. As you can probably already tell, I like wasting my time on personality quizzes. I blame Tumblr. I'm also a feminist, but thank Tumblr for that!! I really don't know how to introduce myself, sorry....</p>
